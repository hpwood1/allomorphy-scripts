# allomorphy-scripts
Scripts used in the work conducted for the research article titled, 'Allomorphy as a mechanism of post-translational control of enzyme activity'.

Three sets of scripts:
1) For processing raw data from the BMG Labtech Omega platereader.
2) For extracting initial rates from the processed kinetic data.
3) For fitting the initial rates to obtain kinetic parameters.

Each individual directory has a README associated with it.
